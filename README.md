# Navbar with Animated Menu

This is a React component that can easily be inserted into your react project

This does use an SCSS file so SASS needs to be added to dependencies

Heading color can be changed in Navbar.css

Menu color can be changed in Menu.css

Hamburger color and stroke width can be changed in HamburgerMenu.scss
